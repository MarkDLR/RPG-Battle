# RPG-Battle
RPG Battle is my first try at a game on React, I plan to further update and create a beter user experience in the game.

At the moment a user can make a character between two jobs (barbarian and a knight) the new character will have base stats and the job chosen will add to the character stats.

the user can equip and unequip items and the stats will change depending on the items equipped.

Once a character is chosen the user can choose between monster difficulties. Depending on the difficulty a random monster will be chosen in the corresponding array. 

The user can earn items by defeating the monster with the attack button.
